Captcha

To solve the captcha, you have to select four image parts that do not match the main image.

If you want to insert your logo in the loading page, you have to replace here “[Base64 code]” with the Base64 code of your .png image:

&lt;img src="data:image/png;base64,[Base64 code]" alt="Forum-Logo" class="splash-logo"&gt;

Usage:
Place a few image parts (at least seven recommended) in the captchas/false_parts folder, each as .jpg. And in the captchas/originals folder, place a few normal images (at least seven recommended), also each as .jpg.
